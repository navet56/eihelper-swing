/**
 * This class should be used as a replacement for the java.util.Observable class which is deprecated.
 * This implementation of the Observer pattern allows more flexibility than the original java one.
 * <br>
 * This class represents an observable object, or "data" in the model-view paradigm.
 * It can be subclassed to represent an object that the application wants to have observed.
 * <br>
 * An observable object can have one or more observers. An observer may be any object that implements interface Observer.
 * <br>
 * The order in which notifications will be delivered is unspecified. The default implementation provided in the Observable class will notify Observers in the order in which they registered interest, but subclasses may change this order, use no guaranteed order, deliver notifications on separate threads, or may guarantee that their subclass follows this order, as they choose.
 * <br>
 * Note that this notification mechanism is has nothing to do with threads and is completely separate from the wait and notify mechanism of class Object.
 * <br>
 * When an observable object is newly created, its set of observers is empty.
 *
 * @param <T> A sub type of Observer, it allows to use methods of this T type.
 * @param <U> A sub type of Observable, it allows to use methods of this U type.
